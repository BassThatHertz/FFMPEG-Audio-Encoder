#  ------------FFMPEG-Audio-Encoder -------------------
First stable release of a project I have been working on for a few weeks.
It's coded completely in python and it's completely portable. 

It is powered with FFMPEG/FFPROBE and has as portable version of MediaInfo, these are all required for the app to run.
All of these are included with the programs in their own folders. They do not need your PATH adjusted to run. 

If you want to use a specific version of FFPROBE/FFMPEG you can easily just replace them in the programs folders and it should work great.


## --------------------- Instructions ------------------------


##### 1) Open your file
##### 2) You will have the options to open your selected file with mediainfo and select an encoder for it. (Mediainfo selection is optional)
##### 3) After you select which codec you want to use to encode/extract with you can then select 'Audio Settings' to open a sub window.
##### 4) You can choose what ever options you want. After words be sure to press 'Apply'
##### 5) The program will automatically select a new name/file location based off of file input. You can choose a different option with the 'Save File' button.
