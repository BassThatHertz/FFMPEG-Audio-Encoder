qaac 2.59
Usage: qaac [options] infiles....

"-" as infile means stdin.
On ADTS/WAV output mode, "-" as outfile means stdout.

Main options:
--formats              Show available AAC formats and exit
-a, --abr     AAC ABR mode / bitrate
-V, --tvbr          AAC True VBR mode / quality [0-127]
-v, --cvbr    AAC Constrained VBR mode / bitrate
-c, --cbr     AAC CBR mode / bitrate
                       For -a, -v, -c, "0" as bitrate means "highest".
                       Highest bitrate available is automatically chosen.
                       For LC, default is -V90
                       For HE, default is -v0
--he                   HE AAC mode (TVBR is not available)
-q, --quality       AAC encoding Quality [0-2]
--adts                 ADTS output (AAC only)
--no-smart-padding     Don't apply smart padding for gapless playback.
                       By default, beginning and ending of input is
                       extrapolated to achieve smooth transition between
                       songs. This option also works as a workaround for
                       bug of CoreAudio HE-AAC encoder that stops encoding
                       1 frame too early.
                       Setting this option can lead to gapless playback
                       issue especially on HE-AAC.
                       However, resulting bitstream will be identical with
                       iTunes only when this option is set.
-d            Output directory. Default is current working dir.
--check                Show library versions and exit.
-A, --alac             ALAC encoding mode
-D, --decode           Decode to a WAV file.
--caf                  Output to CAF file instead of M4A/WAV/AAC.
--play                 Decode to a WaveOut device (playback).
-r, --rate 
                       keep: output sampling rate will be same as input
                             if possible.
                       auto: output sampling rate will be automatically
                             chosen by encoder.
                       n: desired output sampling rate in Hz.
--lowpass      Specify lowpass filter cut-off frequency in Hz.
                       Use this when you want lower cut-off than
                       Apple default.
-b, --bits-per-sample 
                       Bits per sample of output (for WAV/ALAC only)
--no-dither            Turn off dither when quantizing to lower bit depth.
--peak                 Scan + print peak (don't generate output file).
                       Cannot be used with encoding mode or -D.
                       When DSP options are set, peak is computed
                       after all DSP filters have been applied.
--gain              Adjust gain by f dB.
                       Use negative value to decrese gain, when you want to
                       avoid clipping introduced by DSP.
-N, --normalize        Normalize (works in two pass. can generate HUGE
                       tempfile for large piped input)
--drc 
                       Dynamic range compression.
                       Loud parts over threshold are attenuated by ratio.
                         thresh:  threshold (in dBFS, < 0.0)
                         ratio:   compression ratio (> 1.0)
                         knee:    knee width (in dB, >= 0.0)
                         attack:  attack time (in millis, >= 0.0)
                         release: release time (in millis, >= 0.0)
--limiter              Apply smart limiter that softly clips portions
                       where peak exceeds (near) 0dBFS
--start s|f>
                       Specify start point of the input.
                       You specify either in seconds(hh:mm:ss.sss..form) or
                       number of samples followed by 's' or
                       cuesheet frames(mm:ss:ff form) followed by 'f'.
                       Example:
                         --start 4010160s : start at 4010160 samples
                         --start 1:30:70f : same as above, in cuepoint
                         --start 1:30.93333 : same as above
--end s|f>
                       Specify end point of the input (exclusive).
--delay s|f>
                       Specify amount of delay.
                       When positive value is given, silence is prepended
                       at the begining to achieve specified amount of delay.
                       When negative value is given, specified length is
                       dropped from the beginning.
--no-delay             Compensate encoder delay by prepending 960 samples
                       of scilence, then trimming 3 AAC frames from
                       the beginning (and also tweak iTunSMPB).
                       This option is mainly intended for resolving
                       A/V sync issue of video.
--num-priming       (Experimental). Set arbitrary number of priming
                       samples in range from 0 to 2112 (default 2112).
                       Applicable only for AAC LC.
                       --num-priming=0 is the same as --no-delay.
                       Doesn't work with --no-smart-padding.
--gapless-mode      Encoder delay signaling for gapless playback.
                         0: iTunSMPB (default)
                         1: ISO standard (elst + sbgp + sgpd)
                         2: Both
--matrix-preset  Specify user defined preset for matrix mixer.
--matrix-file    Matrix file for remix.
--no-matrix-normalize  Don't automatically normalize(scale) matrix
                       coefficients for the matrix mixer.
--chanmap    Rearrange input channels to the specified order.
                       Example:
                         --chanmap 2,1 -> swap L and R.
                         --chanmap 2,3,1 -> C+L+R -> L+R+C.
--chanmask          Force input channel mask(bitmap).
                       Either decimal or hex number with 0x prefix
                       can be used.
                       When 0 is given, qaac works as if no channel mask is
                       present in the source and picks default layout.
--no-optimize          Don't optimize MP4 container after encoding.
--tmpdir      Specify temporary directory. Default is %TMP%
-s, --silent           Suppress console messages.
--verbose              More verbose console messages.
-i, --ignorelength     Assume WAV input and ignore the data chunk length.
--threading            Enable multi-threading.
-n, --nice             Give lower process priority.
--sort-args            Sort filenames given by command line arguments.
--text-codepage     Specify text code page of cuesheet/chapter/lyrics.
                       Example: 1252 for Latin-1, 65001 for UTF-8.
                       Use this when bogus values are written into tags
                       due to automatic encoding detection failure.
-S, --stat             Save bitrate statistics into file.
--log        Output message to file.

Option for output filename generation:
--fname-from-tag       Generate filename based on metadata of input.
                       By default, output filename will be the same as input
                       (only different by the file extension).
                       Name generation can be tweaked by --fname-format.
--fname-format    Format string for output filename.

Option for single output:
-o           Specify output filename
--concat               Encodes whole inputs into a single file.
                       Requires output filename (with -o)

Option for cuesheet input only:
--cue-tracks 
                       Limit extraction to specified tracks.
                       Tracks can be specified with comma separated numbers.
                       Hyphen can be used to denote range of numbers.
                       Tracks non-existent in the cue are just ignored.
                       Numbers must be in the range 0-99.
                       Example:
                         --cue-tracks 1-3,6-9,11
                           -> equivalent to --cue-tracks 1,2,3,6,7,8,9,11
                         --cue-tracks 2-99
                           -> can be used to skip first track (and HTOA)

Options for Raw PCM input only:
-R, --raw              Raw PCM input.
--raw-channels      Number of channels, default 2.
--raw-rate          Sample rate, default 44100.
--raw-format      Sample format, default S16L.
                       Sample format spec:
                       1st char: S(igned) | U(nsigned) | F(loat)
                       2nd part: Bitwidth
                       Last part: L(ittle Endian) | B(ig Endian)
                       Last part can be omitted, L is assumed by default.
                       Cases are ignored. u16b is OK.

Options for CoreAudio sample rate converter:
--native-resampler[=line|norm|bats,n]
                       Arguments are optional.
                       Without argument, codec default SRC is used.
                       With argument, dedicated AudioConverter is used for
                       sample rate conversion.
                       '--native-resampler' and arguments must be delimited
                       by a '=' (space is not usable here).
                       Arguments must be delimited by a ','(comma).
                       First argument is sample rate converter complexity,
                       and one of line, norm, bats.
                         line: linear (worst, don't use this)
                         norm: normal
                         bats: mastering (best, but quite sloooow)
                       Second argument is sample rate converter quality,
                       which is an integer between 0-127.
                       Example:
                         --native-resampler
                         --native-resampler=norm,96

Tagging options:
 (same value is set to all files, so use with care for multiple files)
--title 
--artist 
--band        This means "Album Artist".
--album 
--grouping 
--composer 
--comment 
--genre 
--date 
--track 
--disk 
--compilation[=0|1]
                      By default, iTunes compilation flag is not set.
                      --compilation or --compilation=1 sets flag on.
                      --compilation=0 is same as default.
--lyrics 
--artwork 
--artwork-size     Specify maximum width or height of artwork in pixels.
                      If specified artwork (with --artwork) is larger than
                      this, artwork is automatically resized.
--copy-artwork        Copy front cover art(APIC:type 3) from the source.
                      When --artwork is also given, this option is ignored.
--chapter 
                      Set chapter from file.
--tag :
                      Set iTunes pre-defined tag with fourcc key
                      and value.
                      1) When key starts with U+00A9 (copyright sign),
                         you can use 3 chars starting from the second char
                         instead.
                      2) Some known tags having type other than UTF-8 string
                         are taken care of. Others are just stored as UTF-8
                         string.
--tag-from-file :
                      Same as above, but value is read from file.
--long-tag :
                      Set long tag (iTunes custom metadata) with
                      arbitrary key/value pair. Value is always stored as
                      UTF8 string.
