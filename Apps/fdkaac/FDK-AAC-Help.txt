       -o <FILE>
              Output filename.

       -p, --profile <n>
              Target profile (MPEG4 audio object type, AOT)

              2      MPEG-4 AAC LC (default)

              5      MPEG-4 HE-AAC (SBR)

              29     MPEG-4 HE-AAC v2 (SBR+PS)

              23     MPEG-4 AAC LD

              39     MPEG-4 AAC ELD

       -b, --bitrate <n>
              Target bitrate (for CBR)

       -m, --bitrate-mode <n>
              Bitrate   configuration  mode.   Available  VBR  quality  value  depends  on  other
              parameters such as profile, sample rate, or number of channels.

              0      CBR (default)

              1-5    VBR (higher value -> higher bitrate)

       -w, --bandwidth <n>
              Frequency bandwidth (lowpass cut-off frequency) in Hz.  Available on AAC LC only.

       -a, --afterburner <n>
              Configure afterburner mode.  When enabled, quality is increased at the  expense  of
              additional computational workload.

              0      Off

              1      On (default)

       -L, --lowdelay-sbr <n>
              Configure SBR activity on AAC ELD.

              -1     Use ELD SBR auto configuration

              0      Disable SBR on ELD (default)

              1      Enable SBR on ELD

       -s, --sbr-ratio <n>
              Controls activation of downsampled SBR.

              0      Use lib default (default)

              1      Use downsampled SBR (default for ELD+SBR)

              2      Use dual-rate SBR (default for HE-AAC)

              Dual-rate SBR is what is normally used for HE-AAC, where AAC is encoded at half the
              sample rate of SBR, hence "dual rate".  On the other  hand,  downsampled  SBR  uses
              same  sample  rate for both of AAC and SBR (single rate), therefore downsampled SBR
              typically consumes more bitrate.

              Downsampled SBR is newly introduced feature in FDK encoder library version  3.4.12.
              When  libfdk-aac  in  the  system doesn't support this, dual-rate SBR will be used.
              When available, dual-rate SBR is the default for HE-AAC and downsampled SBR is  the
              default for ELD+SBR.

              Note  that  downsampled HE-AAC is not so common as dual-rate one.  When downsampled
              HE-AAC is selected, fdkaac is forced to choose explicit hierarchical SBR signaling,
              which (at least) iTunes doesn't accept.

       -f, --transport-format <n>
              Transport  format.   Tagging  and  gapless  playback  is  only  available  on  M4A.
              Streaming to stdout is only available on others.

              0      M4A (default)

              1      ADIF

              2      ADTS

              6      LATM MCP=1

              7      LATM MCP=0

              10     LOAS/LATM (LATM within LOAS)

       -C, --adts-crc-check
              Add CRC protection on ADTS header.

       -h, --header-period <n>
              StreamMuxConfig/PCE repetition period in the transport layer.

       -G, --gapless-mode <n>
              Method to declare amount of encoder delay (and padding) in  M4A  container.   These
              values are mandatory for proper gapless playback on player side.

              0      iTunSMPB (default)

              1      ISO standard (edts and sgpd)

              2      Both

       --include-sbr-delay
              When specified, count SBR decoder delay in encoder delay.

              This  is  not  iTunes compatible and will lead to gapless playback issue on LC only
              decoder, but this is the default behavior of FDK library.

              Whether  counting  SBR  decoder  delay  in  encoder  delay   or   not   result   in
              incompatibility  in gapless playback.  You should pick which one will work for your
              favorite player.

              However, it's better not to choose SBR at all if you  want  gapless  playback.   LC
              doesn't have such issues.

       -I, --ignorelength
              Ignore length field of data chunk in input WAV file.

       -S, --silent
              Don't print progress messages.

       --moov-before-mdat
              Place  moov  box  before mdat box in M4A container.  This option might be important
              for some hardware players, that are known to refuse moov box placed after mdat box.

       -R, --raw
              Regard input as raw PCM.
